RPG Game
========

This is the beginnings of a graphical rogue-like game.

It will run in the browser, via HTML5/canvas and javascript.
It is also planned to have a "native" version (a C or C++ binary which
opens a window and renders the graphics).

The license is GNU GPL v3 (or any later version).

Planned stuff which will set it apart from other rogue-likes:

*  control a party of several characters
*  try to avoid "yet another stupid death" syndrome
*  better NPC characters, chatting, trading of items
*  no separate levels, the dungeon is one large playfield
*  ability to type complex commands, like in text adventures
*  no need to identify objects

The tileset was colorized (no mean feat!) by PriorBlue (user of OpenGameArt.org).
