RPG Game
========

This is the beginnings of a graphical rogue-like game.

It will run in the browser, via HTML5/canvas and javascript.

The license is the GNU GPL v3 (or any later version).

Planned stuff which will set it apart from NetHack:

* try to avoid "yet another stupid death" syndrome
* better NPC characters, chatting, trading of items
* more interesting layouts of dungeons
* no separate levels, the dungeon is one large playfield (e.g. 50 tiles across but 1000 tiles high)
* smaller in scope, less monsters, less items, less stats to worry about
* no need to identify objects
